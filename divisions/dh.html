            leader of Dotsuitare Honpo.<br><br>
            A stand up comedian. Though on stage he's a genius at making people laugh, in private, for some reason he
            repeats tacky gags. He and Rosho
            were in a manzai duo together as Dotsuitare Honpo, but they disbanded and he now works as a solo artist. The
            name Dotsuitare Honpo
            was later inherited to become their new team name.<br><br>
            A long time ago, he teamed up with Yokohama Division's <a href="mtc.html#samatoki">Samatoki</a> as Mad Comic
            Dialogue.<br><br>

            students.<br><br>
            He used to be in a comedy duo with Sasara Nurude. known as "Dotsuitare Honpo", but because of a traumatic
            event, to this day,
            he developed a crippling stage fright and became unable to speak well in front of large crowds. Normally, he
            speaks standard Japanese,
            but in front of his friends and Sasara, or at times when he is really angry, he lets his guard down and
            speaks in Kansai dialect.<br><br>

            the scenes, although this speculation
            is engulfed in mystery.<br><br>
            As charming as he is, he'll stop at nothing to carry out his plans. Although he always keeps an
            arrogant-like behavior and does not show his real
            intentions, at the same time, he is a man of his word with a strong sense of duty.<br><br>
