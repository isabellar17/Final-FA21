            former member of Mad Comic Dialogue and The Dirty Dawg.<br><br>
            A former member of The Dirty Dawg and the second-in-command (wakagashira) of the Katen Family, yakuza clan
            based in Yokohama.<br><br>
            He has a perpetual frown on his face and is quick to start a fight if something displeases him, but he would
            never raise a hand against a woman. He even became a yakuza for his beloved little sister, Nemu Aohitsugi.
            He treasures the good luck charm she made for him.<br><br>

            He and <a href="bb.html#ichiro">Ichiro Yamada</a> from Ikebukuro Division hate each other’s guts.<br><br>

        <h3>Jyuto Iruma, a.k.a. 45 Rabbit, is a corrupt police officer and the second member of MAD TRIGGER
            CREW.<br><br>
            An active-duty police sergeant in the Organized Crime Unit of the Yokohama Police Department.
            He joined the force to stomp out drug trade, but he’s in deep with the yakuza and gets his hands
            dirty with a wide variety of criminal activities including assault, bribes, embezzlement, extortion,
            and blackmail, just to name a few. He’s developed a mutually beneficial relationship with Samatoki
            Aohitsugi through his beat.<br><br>
            As the resident problem-solver, he’s often tasked with putting out fires within the Yokohama
            Division.<br><br>
            His catchphrase is, "I’m throwing you in the slammer!"<br><br>

        <h3>Rio Mason Busujima, a.k.a. Crazy M, is the former Navy soldier and the third member of MAD TRIGGER CREW.<br><br>
            A former Sergeant First Class of the Naval Forces and the member of the Special Extermination Operations
            Unit. Half-American on his
            father's side, and half-Japanese on his mother's. He speaks and behaves as if he were still a soldier.
            During his time as a naval officer,
            he respected rank above anything else. For example, if a superior told him that white was black, then white
            was black. In dire circumstances,
            he shows no mercy to his enemies.<br><br>
            That being said, he's calmer in peacetime and likes to help people. His hobby is cooking food that serves a
            practical purpose.
            His skills are those of a professional, but for some reason, Samatoki and Jyuto fear him.<br><br>

            <blockquote>&ldquo; I submit to you that if a man hasn't discovered something that he will die for, he isn't
                fit to live. &rdquo;
