        <h3 class="text">Ichiro Yamada, a.k.a. MC.B.B, is the manager of Odd-Jobs Yamada, former member of Naughty
            Busters,
            Mad Comic Dialogue and The Dirty Dawg and the current leader of Buster Bros!!!.<br><br>
            He is a former member of The Dirty Dawg, the oldest son of the Yamada family, and proprietor of Odd Jobs
            Yamada.
            He used to be such an infamous delinquent that it was said that there wasn’t a single person in Ikebukuro
            who didn’t know his name.
            He’s a very compassionate person with a deep-seated sense of justice who can’t bring himself to ignore
            people in need.
            Everyone admires him for how well he looks after his little brothers. As a hardcore nerd, his hobbies
            include watching
            anime and keeping up with all the latest light novels.<br><br>
            He and <a href="mtc.html#samatoki">Samatoki Aohitsugi</a>, leader of the Yokohama Division, hate each
            other’s guts.<br><br>

        <h3>Jiro Yamada, a.k.a. MC.M.B, is a high school student, a part-timer at the Odd-Jobs Yamada and the second
            member of Buster Bros!!!.<br><br>
            Second son of the Yamada household and Buster Bros!!!. A strong fighter. He idolizes Ichiro Yamada, who is
            beloved by everyone.
            He grew up watching his big brother's back, and thus became a delinquent like him.<br><br>
            Just like Ichiro, he hates bullies. Due to his big brother's influence, he is well-versed in anime and light
            novels.<br><br>
            Anyone who makes fun of his big brother will be crushed out (or will be devoured) and he always fights with
            Saburo Yamada.<br><br>

        <h3>Saburo Yamada, a.k.a. MC.L.B, is a middle school student, a part-timer at Odd-Jobs Yamada and the third
            member of Buster Bros!!!.<br><br>
            Third son of the Yamada household and the youngest in Buster Bros!!!. A genius-type who can do just about
            anything. Unlike his brothers, not a delinquent.<br><br>
            Respects and looks up to Ichiro. Thought about becoming a delinquent at first, but after Jiro became the one
            to follow in Ichiro's footsteps, he decided against it.<br><br>
            Generally has good behavior, but will ridicule someone the moment he thinks they are beneath him. His
            hobbies are board games and card games.<br><br>
            Because of his twisted personality, he doesn't have many friends. Wants someone he can always be together
            with.<br><br>
