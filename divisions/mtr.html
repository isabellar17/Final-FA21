            current leader of Matenrou.<br><br>
            He is a genius doctor, once under contract to eliminate terrorists, he became a doctor to atone for his
            sinful way of life. Though he often
            goes to areas of conflict around the world, he is currently practicing at the Shinjuku Central Hospital.<br><br>
            His drinking habits are terrible, and once he drinks, he goes on a rampage with an Edo dialect.<br><br>
            He has a cat and dog relationship with <a href="fp.html#ramuda">Ramuda</a>, leader of the Shibuya
            Division.<br><br>

        <h3>Hifumi Izanami, a.k.a. GIGOLO, is a host and the second member of Matenrou.<br><br>
            A host who works at the "Fragrance" host club in Shinjuku, Hifumi radiates confidence and charisma at first
            sight. However, despite
            the impression that his gregarious nature and carefree tone gives off, Hifumi is in actuality completely
            terrified of women.
            He became a host in attempts to conquer his fear, and after much toil, he learned to transform himself into
            a womanizer once he dons his suit.<br><br>
            Hifumi is extremely dexterous and has a wide range of hobbies ranging from the indoor to the
            outdoor.<br><br>
            He and Doppo have known each other since they were in elementary school, and he frequently mends Doppo’s
            torn suits for him. The two share an apartment.<br><br>

        <h3>Doppo Kannonzaka, a.k.a. DOPPO, is a salaryman and the third member of Matenrou.<br><br>
            A sales representative at the E.L. Medical Co., Ltd, a manufacturer of medical equipment, whose most notable
            characteristic
            is that he has no notable characteristics.<br><br>
            He’s a pessimist and thinks about everything in a negative light, so friends are not exactly something he
            has in spades.
            In fact, Hifumi Izanami is his only friend, and they’ve been close ever since elementary school.<br><br>
            Despite the number of awful situations he’s found himself in because of Hifumi, he’s still glad to have him
            around.<br><br>
