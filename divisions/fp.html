        <h3>Ramuda Amemura, a.k.a. easy R, is a fashion designer, former member of Kujaku Posse and The Dirty Dawg, and
            the current leader of Fling Posse.<br><br>
            He is the producer of the fashion brand 'Empty Candy'.<br><br>
            He looks as young as a primary school student, but is quick-witted and calculating, though he often makes
            absent-minded remarks with a frequent lack of tact in his words. He's very popular with women due to his
            cuteness. He is connected to Chuohku and
            holds a great secret that can't be told to anyone.<br><br>

            A peculiar figure. He has a cat and dog relationship with <a href="mtr.html#jakurai">Jakurai</a>, leader of
            the Shinjuku
            Division.<br><br>

        <h3>Gentaro Yumeno, a.k.a. Phantom, is a novelist and the second member of Fling Posse.<br><br>
            A writer who dresses like an intellectual from a bygone era. He enjoys making up stories about the lives of
            the strangers he passes on the street.<br><br>
            He is an extremely persuasive liar and often times those lies would go unnoticed were it not for his habit
            of teasing the gullible by telling them,
            “That was just a lie”.<br><br>

        <h3>Dice Arisugawa, a.k.a. Dead or Alive, is a gambler and the third member of Fling Posse.<br><br>
            A gambler so addicted to the game he’ll lay not only whatever cash he can get his hands on, but even his
            life, down on the table for the right bet.<br><br>
            There’s nothing he despises more than the phrase, “the straight and narrow”, and he’s only survived as long
            as he has thanks to the extraordinarily
            good luck he was born with. He makes all of his decisions with the dice he carries around.<br><br>
            As often as he finds himself flat broke, he’s quick to latch onto anyone who will feed him.<br><br>
