            He is the heir of the Kugen temple, a renowned Buddhist temple. At 14, he mastered an ascetic life his
            father,
            Shakku Harai, was unable to. He's badmouthed and his behavior is inappropriate for a monk yet, his faith is
            deep
            and he treasures his friends. He often makes up moralising-like remarks. He hates crowds and often acts
            alone.<br><br><br>
            In the past, he was a part of Naughty Busters with <a href="bb.html#ichiro">Ichiro Yamada</a> in

            He is a vocalist in ArgoÎ¾Orchestra, Visual kei band. A narcissist crybaby. He doesn't have many friends, but
            he cherishes his stuffed
            plushie pig named "Amanda" who is 45 years old. When he meets someone for the first time or is nervous, his
            personality changes
            and he talks in a pompous and exaggerated tone. When he was a student, he was harshly bullied. At the time,
            Hitoya Amaguni
            advocated for him and has since earned Jyushi's respect.<br><br><br>
